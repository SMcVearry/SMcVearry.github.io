        <div class"blog-content">About the Umbrellas
            <p class="font-change">The world is a scary place, but you know what is even scarier? Going outside without an umbrella. Hi, I am just your average telemarketer asking you to buy things that you don't need for triple the average price. You see, the reason you need the wood-handled umbrella is just that it is fantastic in all ways like how wood it is. By how wood it is I mean how fake the wood is, because the wood is made of 100% recycled materials. You see, not only does this umbrella cost triple the price of anything normal, it also is helping the environment, which not enough people care about. This is why you would want our insanely overpriced umbrella because helping the environment is key to everything, so if you like the environment buy our umbrella. Also don't worry if you hate the environment and want it to burn because the materials we don't use are dumped into all nearby water sources "legally." Now that you have been thoroughly convinced that our company is the best for getting an umbrella at top speeds of 12- to 36-month shipping, unless you buy fast shipping for double the price on the umbrella, in which case you will get the umbrella within the week. So after all this, how could you <em>not</em> get an umbrella at the best Umbrella Place For Cool Umbrellas in your area?</p>
